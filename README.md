## To run the app locally

Use the ```npm run start``` command, and the app will be hosted locally on http://localhost:3000.

## App deployment

The app is hosted on Netlify at this link: https://rainbow-treacle-3687b5.netlify.app/

## App Features

As in accordance with the Figma sent, includes mocked functionalities for Login, Tracking and Statistics. 

Responsive, with hamburger menu for smaller (mobile) viewpoints and standard navbar menu for larger (desktop/tablet) viewpoints.

Built in React.js and Typescript, with inclusion of Tailwind CSS to assist with styling.

## Limitations

- Tracking and Statistics data are not user-specific, can be mocked using key-value pairs in the JSON files.
- Unit tests are not created at this point.
- Form validation for login page only checks if field is populated. Additional functions could be incorporated to check for other discrepancies.
